Welcome to `echarts4r`, let's explore the package together.

1. All functions of the `echarts4r` package start with `e_`.
2. All its [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) proxies end with `_p`. 
3. All `echarts4r` plots are initialised with `e_charts`.
4. All functions are `|>` friendly.
5. Most functions have escape hatches ending in `_`.

Thanks to [Sharon Machlis](https://twitter.com/sharon000) there is an amazing video and [article](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3607068/plot-in-r-with-echarts4r.html) introducing echarts4r.

## Your first plot

Let's build a line chart. First, we'll prepare the data, load the library and pipe the data to `e_charts`.

```{r}
# prepare data
df <- airquality

# pad month/day with leading zero and convert to date
df$Month <- sprintf("%02d", df$Month)
df$Day <- sprintf("%02d", df$Day)

df$Date <- paste("1973", df$Month, df$Day, sep = "-") |> 
  as.Date(format = "%Y-%m-%d")
```

```{r}
library(echarts4r) # load echarts4r

df |> 
  e_charts(x = Date) |> # initialise and set x
  e_line(serie = Temp) # add a line
```

If you wish to use column names as quoted strings you can use the escape hatches with functions ending in `_`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
df |> 
  e_charts_("Date") |> 
  e_line_("Temp")
```

The easiest way to build your charts is to use the `|>` pipe operator to add plots, elements and options. Notice that the charts are interactable without any specific code additions. Try expanding the average wind speed view by clicking on *Temp* in the legend to disable the temperature line.

```{r}
df |> 
  e_charts(Date) |> 
  e_line(Temp) |>  # add a line
  e_area(Wind) # add area
```

## Options

We could also change the lines to make them `smooth`.

```{r}
df |> 
  e_charts(Date) |> # initialise and set x
  e_line(Temp, smooth = TRUE) |>  # add a line
  e_area(Wind, smooth = TRUE) # add area
```

Lets label the X axis with the convenience function `e_axis_labels`.

```{r}
df |> 
  e_charts(Date) |> # initialise and set x
  e_line(Temp, smooth = TRUE) |>  # add a line
  e_area(Wind, smooth = TRUE) |> # add area
  e_axis_labels(x = "1973.") # axis label
```

We can use one of the 13 built-in themes to style the chart, see `?e_theme` for a complete list. We'll also add a title with `e_title`.

```{r}
df |> 
  e_charts(Date) |> # initialise and set x
  e_line(Temp, smooth = TRUE) |>  # add a line
  e_area(Wind, smooth = TRUE) |> # add area
  e_axis_labels(x = "1973.") |> # axis label
  e_title("New York Air Quality Data", "Maximum daily temperature and mean wind speed") |>  # Add title & subtitle
  e_theme("infographic") # theme
```

The legend and title are a bit close, let's move the legend to another part the canvas.

```{r}
df |> 
  e_charts(Date) |> # initialise and set x
  e_line(Temp, smooth = TRUE) |>  # add a line
  e_area(Wind, smooth = TRUE) |> # add area
  e_axis_labels(x = "1973.") |> # axis label
  e_title("New York Air Quality Data", "Maximum daily temperature and mean wind speed") |>  # Add title & subtitle
  e_theme("infographic") |>  # theme
  e_legend(right = 0) # move legend to the top right corner
```

Add a tooltip, of which there are numerous [options](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#tooltip). Here, we use `trigger = "axis"` to trigger the tooltip across the whole y axis for a given day, rather than on individual data points.

```{r}
df |> 
  e_charts(Date) |> # initialise and set x
  e_line(Temp, smooth = TRUE) |>  # add a line
  e_area(Wind, smooth = TRUE) |> # add area
  e_axis_labels(x = "1973.") |> # axis label
  e_title("New York Air Quality Data", "Maximum daily temperature and mean wind speed") |>  # Add title & subtitle
  e_theme("infographic") |>  # theme
  e_legend(right = 0) |> # move legend to the top right corner
  e_tooltip(trigger = "axis") # tooltip
```

Finally, we are currently plotting temperature and wind speed on the same axis, let's put them each on their respective y axis by specifying an extra axis for Wind.

<span class="label label-warning"><i class="fa fa-warning"></i></span> Dual y axes are not considered good data visualisation practice, they are only here for demonstration purposes.

```{r}
df |> 
  e_charts(Date) |> # initialise and set x
  e_line(Temp, smooth = TRUE) |>  # add a line
  e_area(Wind, smooth = TRUE, y_index = 1) |> # add area
  e_axis_labels(x = "1973.") |> # axis label
  e_title("New York Air Quality Data", "Maximum daily temperature and mean wind speed") |>  # Add title & subtitle
  e_theme("infographic") |>  # theme
  e_legend(right = 0) |> # move legend to the top right corner
  e_tooltip(trigger = "axis") # tooltip
```

## Navigate options

`echarts4r` is highly customisable. There are too many options to have them all hard-coded in the package but rest assured; they are available, and can be passed to `...`. You will find all these options in the [official documentation](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html).

<a href="https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html" class="btn btn-default" target="_blank">
  <i class="fa fa-book"></i>
  Official Documentation
</a>

For instance the documentation for the tooltip looks like this:

<a href="https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#tooltip" target="_blank">
  <img src="https://echarts4r.john-coene.com/articles/docs.png" class="img-responsive responsive-img" />
</a>

Therefore if we want to change our tooltip to an [axisPointer](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#tooltip.axisPointer) we can do so by passing a list to `axisPointer`.   
If an option takes a single value, we don't need to wrap it in a list. For example, we can try changing the tooltip [backgroundColor](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#tooltip.backgroundColor).

```{r}
df |> 
  e_charts(Date) |> # initialise and set x
  e_line(Temp, smooth = TRUE) |>  # add a line
  e_area(Wind, smooth = TRUE) |> # add area
  e_axis_labels(x = "1973.") |> # axis label
  e_title("New York Air Quality Data", "Maximum daily temperature and mean wind speed") |>  # Add title & subtitle
  e_theme("infographic") |>  # theme
  e_legend(right = 0) |> # move legend to the bottom
  e_tooltip(
    axisPointer = list(
      type = "cross"
    ),
    backgroundColor = "#FFFFFF" # hex code for white color
  ) 
```

Once you come to the realisation that JSON ~= `list` in R, it's pretty easy.
