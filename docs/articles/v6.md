## New chart features

Scatter charts now support support an attribute called jitter. Jitter
helps prevent overlap of data points to make the distribution of points
easier to see. You can access this feature with `e_jitter`

<div id="cb1" class="sourceCode">

``` r
df <- data.frame(
  value = c(rnorm(50, mean = 5, sd = 1),
            rnorm(50, mean = 10, sd = 1)),
  group = rep(c("Group A", "Group B"), each = 50)
  )

df |> 
  e_charts(group) |> 
  e_scatter(value, legend = FALSE) |> 
  e_jitter(jitter = 30, jitterOverlap = FALSE)
```

</div>

</div>

Bar charts now support a new axis break effect referred to as zigzags.
This helps to show data where there are large differences in elements.
You can click the break to expand to the original data ratio. This can
be accessed with `e_zigzag`

<div id="cb2" class="sourceCode">

``` r
df <- data.frame(
              x = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "c"),
              y = c(100, 200, 200, 700, 250)
             )

df |>
  e_charts(x) |>
  e_bar(y, legend = FALSE) |>
  e_zigzag(axis = 'y', start = 300, end = 600)
```

## Matrix coordinate system

One of the largest updates for Echarts v6 is the development of the new
matrix coordinate system. This function in a similar method as the
previous grid system. The matrix system allows you to build out charts
using a table style layout in which you can combine various charts into
one final product.

Using this new layout system, users can combine various chart types and
components to create even more complex visuals. See
[Matrix](http://echarts4r.john-coene.com/articles/vignette(%22matrix%22))
for additional details.

  e_scatter(wt) |>
  e_annotations(
    annotations = list(
      list(
        id = 0,
        x = 16,
        y = 3.1,
        offsetY = 40,
        offsetX = -40,
        text = 'An annotation!'
